My personal website/blog. Forever a work-in-progress. This will eventually replace my current site, which I have shamefully neglected.

Though truth be told, I'll probably neglect this one, too. This project is mostly just an excuse to play with some new stuff I've learned since the last time I tried the blogging thing.
