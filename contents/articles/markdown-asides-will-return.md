title: markdownAsides will return
date: 7 November 2013 EST

One of the things that got lost in the transition [to my new set-up](/2013/11/06/four-point-oh/) is my jQuery plugin markdownAsides. On previous iterations of this blog, I used it to transform Markdown Extra style footnotes into sidenotes. As of now, the project page for that plugin returns a 404. This is temporary and will be fixed soon.

Perhaps you think I've negelected it, which isn't entirely false. But in fact, since I last wrote about markdownAsides it's been completely rebuilt using best practices. It's got some cool new features and works better than ever. I intend to open source it on GitHub and register it with Bower (and eventually maybe as a Node package, though it's really intended for the browser). None of this will be too difficult, although I do have a few other things on my plate at the moment, so it may take some time. I'd like to say it'll be done within the week but I can't promise that.

In the meantime, if you've come to this site from Google or elsewhere, please be patient. I hope you'll understand. Check back here in a week or so.
