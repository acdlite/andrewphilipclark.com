title: WordPress *finally* adds native Markdown support

Actually, it's only WordPress.com blogs that have been Markdown-enabled, though [it looks like](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/markdown/#comment-187848) the feature will soon be available to self-hosted WordPress sites via the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me) plugin.

Third-party Markdown plugins have existed for years, but now that Markdown will soon become a (semi-) native feature, it will reach a broader audience than ever before. This is great news. Markdown is beloved by the tech-oriented crowd that forms its base today, but non-techies should have reason to love it even more. I think it's much easier to pick up than HTML, and harder to screw up.

This also makes me think it might be a good idea to package [jQuery.sidenotes](http://acdlite.github.io/jquery.sidenotes/), which deals with Markdown content, as a WordPress plugin.
