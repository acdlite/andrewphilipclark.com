I'm a web and iOS developer, currently living in Gainesville, Florida. I'm an intern at [Parisleaf](http://parisleaf.com) and a student at the University of Florida.

This is my personal website. Sometimes I write things and publish them here. Topics include technology, movies, and occasionally some current events and politics.

## How it's made

This site began as a Tumblr blog. I switched to WordPress shortly after, and then eventually switched to a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered static site. I was quite happy with my Jekyll setup, but it turns out if I go more than a year without completely remaking my blog, I get bored.

Now in its fourth iteration, this site is built using Wintersmith, a static-site generator powered by Node.js. Other tools include:

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), a CSS extension language and pre-processor.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org), a Sass stylesheet framework.
* [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net), a Compass plugin for responsive grids.
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), a programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), a task runner for JavaScript
* [Git](http://git-scm.com), for version control
