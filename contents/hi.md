I'm a web and iOS developer, currently located in Gainesville, Florida. I'm an intern at [Parisleaf](http://parisleaf.com) and a student at the University of Florida.

This is my personal website. Sometimes I write things and publish them here. Topics include technology, movies, and occasionally some current events and politics. For more context, [start here](/2013/11/06/four-point-oh/).
